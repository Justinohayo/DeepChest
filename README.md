# DeepChest Flask Web App

This is a basic Flask-based web application with an HTML frontend. The project follows best practices for Flask app structure, including separate `static` and `templates` folders.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies** (already done):

   - Flask

2. **Run the app:**

   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\python.exe app.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser and go to:**

   [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

## Project Structure

- `app.py` - Main Flask application
- `templates/` - HTML templates
- `static/` - Static files (CSS, JS, images)

## Customization

- Edit `templates/index.html` for the homepage content.
- Add more routes and templates as needed in `app.py` and `templates/`.
